# This script automates the creation and configuration of a Keycloak client.
# 
# Usage:
# ./keycloak-realmcreation.sh <KEYCLOAK_URL> <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> <CLIENT_ID>
#
# Arguments:
#   KEYCLOAK_URL - The base URL of the Keycloak server.
#   USERNAME     - The username for Keycloak admin login.
#   PASSWORD     - The password for Keycloak admin login.
#   CLIENT_ID    - The client ID to be created in Keycloak.
#
# Steps performed by the script:
# 1. Logs in to Keycloak and retrieves an access token.
# 2. Creates a new client with the specified CLIENT_ID.
#    - If the client already exists, it skips the creation.
# 3. Retrieves the UUID of the created client.
# 4. Enables client authentication capability with service account roles checked.
# 5. Updates the realm settings to set the access token lifespan to 15 minutes.
# 6. Retrieves and displays the client secret.
#
# Dependencies:
# - curl: Command-line tool for making HTTP requests.
# - jq: Command-line JSON processor.
#
# Exit codes:
# 0 - Script executed successfully.
# 1 - An error occurred during the execution of the script.
