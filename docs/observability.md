The observability stack offers monitoring solution designed to operate natively within Kubernetes clusters. 
###### It consists of the following key components:
- **Prometheus**: A time-series database and monitoring system that stores metrics from various sources, including Kubernetes components, applications, and custom exporters.
- **Alertmanager**: A component responsible for handling alerts generated by Prometheus based on predefined rules, enabling notifications and other procedures.
- **Grafana**: A powerful data visualization and dashboarding tool that integrates seamlessly with Prometheus, allowing users to create customized dashboards and visualizations for monitoring AI services and resources.
